# My Portfolio (Static)

I have decided rebuild my portfolio site using regular 'ol HTML, CSS, and JS. I wanted to showcase my foundation in the fundementals.

My approach to styling is focused on _mostly_ utility classes. I'll be refactoring as I go to build a clean portfolio.

## Upcoming Features

1. CodePen Embeds of my favorite work
2. JSON Copy of Resume
3. "Stuff I've made" filter by tags
4. Contact form
  - This might prove more challenging. I think I'll have to use PHP for the form to submit data. Need to consider my options still.
